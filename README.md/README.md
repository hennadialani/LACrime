# LACrime
This project explores crime data from 2010 to present in Los Angeles. 
It acts as introductory materials for non-STEM majors to programming - which isn't hard!! It's also a useful tool to visualize ideas
for yourself with cool packages like ggplot and leaflet. Dplyr, tidyr and stringr are all fun packages to clean the data.

It's helpful to work in a team with more *technical* people, but research needs to be reproducible and short scripts to create a graph
can be used over and over again.
Link to data is here: <https://www.dropbox.com/s/1o21zixp5it9qrs/Crime_Data_From_2010_to_Present.csv?dl=0>

The HTML version is the R Markdown file I created to demonstrate the flexibility of reporting in R (you can also create this in PDF/
Microsoft Word, though the Leaflet widget would be slightly harder to figure out)

The RMD file shows all of the code, some comments and thoughts while trying out different types of visual exploration and data cleaning.
